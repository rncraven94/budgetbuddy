This is a simple budgeting application that allows users to input deposits and subtract expenses. 
The expenses are grouped in categories and allow users to see what percentage of their expenses are spent in those categories. 
It also allows users to delete rows if they have made a mistake, and will update in real time.
This is version 1 which is designed for the desktop and not mobile use.
